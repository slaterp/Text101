  storyText: "The protestors finished their march at the entrance to the BigCorp
    headquarters.\r\n\rThey were mostly ignored by passersby but the plain clothes
    agents circled around them, their formation every closing about the ignorant
    prey.\r\n\rI watched for a time as one agent, standing at a distance from the
    rest, signalled to them. Doubtless he was the Captain of the team, although dressed
    as a civilian his gilded implant gave away his seniority.\r An explosion sounded
    somewhere in the atmosphere, but it went mostly ignored by the population.\r\n\rWhat
    do you do?\r\n1. Watch the security operation playout\r\n2. Start your mission"
