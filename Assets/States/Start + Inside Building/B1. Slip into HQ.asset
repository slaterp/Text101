  storyText: "The agents set upon the protestors quickly and in the ensuing chaos
    you slip through the detail guarding the entrance to the HQ.\r\n\rThe bottom
    floor of the HQ has been evacuated, presumably out of fear, in equal parts for
    the protestors and security forces, for the ensuing clash outside. The lower
    floor guards barracks are across the room and are unattended as the security
    forces rush to join their comrades outside.\r\n\rAlthough the elevators are disabled,
    you notice a door to the fire stairs.\r\n\rWhat do you do now?\r\n1. Head towards
    the guard barracks\r\n\r2. Use the fire stairs to move up"
