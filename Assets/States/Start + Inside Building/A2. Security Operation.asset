  storyText: 'The agents set upon the protestors with impeccable brutality. The leaders
    are quickly incapacitated as the rest of the protestors are encircled by uniformed
    reinforcements that appear to stream from everywhere: neighboring houses, invisible
    alleyways, some even seem to appear out of thin air, their weapons readily aimed
    at the shouting protestors.

    

    The previous hustle of the civilian
    life seems to stop as many scamper out of the vice the agents have created. Most
    stare quietly while some shout slogans of solidarity with the protestors and
    defiance against the Big Corp. '
