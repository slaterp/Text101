  storyText: 'You enter ''9999'' into the terminal. As you press enter, a blisteringly
    loud siren blasts into your ear. In the confinement of the elevator the sound
    is magnified 1000x and you are hit by waves and waves of noise. You feel the
    elvator jolt to a stop and barely notice as the doors open. The sound has stopped
    but by now you barely maintain a thread of consciousness. The last thing you
    see are the boots as the elevator door opens.

    

    Press 1. to continue...'
