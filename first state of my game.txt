The protestors finished their march at the entrance to the headquarters. Their slogans and chants were drowned by the noise of the city and 
most passerbys ignored them, but the agents still watched closely. Most would not see the units as they closed in on the group, their movements rehearsed
to brutal simplicity, with their plain clothes they blended into the street like chameleons. As the overhead rails clanged past and a small explosion sounded in the sky
suggesting a mining junket had just peirced the atmosphere, I identified the Captain of the team. The man stood well away from the forward units and his smaller frame jarred with
physiques of his soldiers, but doubtless anyone with a history private security like I would pick up on the giveaway traits he possessed. Behind his ear was a port just slightly larger
than typical consumer implants which was compatible with most military-level adaptors. Similarly, if one looked at his eyes and the bridge of his nose on would notice a pattern of 
golden wire (not uncommon, of course, amongst wealthier classes, but they would not dwelling this close to the slums would they?) that ran between his eyes - also a common alteration 
for field officers. 

As the units encirclement continued I sensed now would be a goodtime to move.

What do you do?:
1. Watch the security operation playout
2. Continue with your mission

The protestors finished their march at the entrance to the BigCorp headquarters.

They were mostly ignored by passersby but the plain clothes agents circled around them, their formation every closing about the ignorant prey.

I watched for a time as one agent, standing at a distance from the rest, signalled to them. Doubtless he was the Captain of the team, although dressed as a civilian his gilded implant gave away his seniority.

An explosion sounded somewhere in the atmosphere, but it went mostly ignored by the population.

What do you do?
1. Watch the security operation playout
2. Start your mission
